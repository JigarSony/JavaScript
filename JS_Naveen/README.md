JavaScript used before client side only - validation, form and all
It uses V8 Engine to run on chrome and other browser has other engine
V8 developed/written by Google chromium team and in C++
Then they have created Node.js
JS is client and Node is server runs written in JS

Now JS is also server side programming Lan



￼


Editor Visual Studio Code

In Chrome > console is JS Editor 
You can write JS code there

Console.log()

alert()

That is the JS Engine runs on browser

————
Open VS Code
Create one folder
Create one file index.html
! + tab — some code written

Install live server from extension
Click on index.html and select run on server
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
Add some html code into body—it will display in the url

For JavaScript — inside body there is Script tag


At the end of body — after all html element declare

Better to declare in separate file so created index.js 
And change in script tag like <script src='index.js '>


You can also run index.js file 

Node installed in your machine

Node index.js
